VOPA:
Need TensorFlow to run the script, an executor program has been added to simplify the command line for model training. Please be sure to unzip the image folder under the same directory with the script folder before testing the code.

Example:
|-- image
|-- virtual_classification
|   |-- exe.py
|   |-- modelEvaluator.py
|-- cross_object
|   |-- exe.py
|   |-- modelEvaluator.py



Model Training:
python exe.py

Evaluate the trained model:
python modelEvaluator.py
